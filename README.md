### 🤔 Why This Project?

I created this project to learn the fundamentals of web development while solving a personal need - to easily **watch Re:Zero Openings, Endings, and Insert Songs**. This project has helped me understand more about **browser APIs, state management**, and **performance optimization**.

### ⏱️ Development Timeline

09/20/2024 - 04/28/2025 (= 7 months+)


## 🔮 Philosophical Meaning of the Project

> **"Let's start from here, from square one. No,.. from zero!"** - Rem, Re:Zero

### 💫 Connection to Re:Zero

This project was born because Re:Zero **saved my life** during a dark period. After achieving recognition in a national English competition, I realized people only cared about the medal, not the person behind it. That emptiness pushed me into depression for nearly a year.

Re:Zero came to me then, with its message about starting over from zero and persevering toward something truly meaningful. Like Subaru, I decided to begin anew—not to win awards or recognition, but to create something genuinely valuable to myself.

Starting from zero with no programming experience, I used the most fundamental tools to build this player. Through more than 500 commits over 7+ months, this project has become living proof of Re:Zero's powerful message: **Starting from zero and achieving the impossible through unwavering determination**.


### 🧱 The Most Primitive Approach

This project uses **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for its core functionality. Like Subaru who had to learn everything from zero, I created this project using the most basic elements *(Actually because I didn't know any frameworks when starting the project 😅)*:

- 🏗️ **Hand-crafted** HTML elements
- 🎨 **Basic** CSS features
- 📝 **Simple** JavaScript syntax
- 🔌 **Built-in** Browser APIs


### 💝 The True Meaning of the Project

This project wasn't created because I needed **recognition** or to **demonstrate my technical skills**. Just as Subaru only cares about protecting those he cares for, this project has only one driving motivation: **to watch Re:Zero perfectly**. The technical features are merely side effects of that desire.

## 💻 Technology

### 🧱 Core Technology
The core video player logic is built entirely with:

- **HTML:** Creating the page structure
- **CSS:** Building the user interface
- **JavaScript:** Managing video playback logic

> 💡 All core features are built from zero, without using frameworks.

### 🔌 Supporting Libraries

Secondary features are supported by:

- **Tailwind CSS:** Supporting interface design
- **Flowbite:** Supplementing UI components
- **jQuery:** Simplifying some interactions + creating loading screen
- **MicroModal:** Managing modal dialogs

### 💻 Minimum Hardware Requirements

This project was developed on an unstable laptop:

- 🔲 **CPU:** Intel Core i5-3337U (2013) 
  > If your laptop was purchased after 2013, congratulations, you've exceeded the requirements.

- 🧠 **RAM:** 4GB DDR3 
  > Just one browser tab is all you need to run the project.

- 💾 **Storage:** HDD 5400rpm
  > If you have an SSD, the project will run unbelievably fast.

- ⚡ **Power:** Degraded battery with 30 minutes left
  > The project was still completed despite the laptop shutting down frequently.

🚀 **Fun fact:** This project was developed on a laptop older than many modern phones, but still runs smoother than YouTube on any device.
