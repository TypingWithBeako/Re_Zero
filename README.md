## 20/09/2024 -> 28/01/2025 <br>
- My first project to learn about ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white) and ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E) <br>
- Took me 4 months but it was totally worth it - I understood many concepts that textbooks alone can not teach. <br>
- Feel free to understand my code and make changes! ***(if it's possible)*** since I won't be actively updating this myself :D
